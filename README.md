Technical showcase and architecture overview of ProBarber, a full-stack SaaS platform built with Laravel, Angular, and PHP. Focused on scalability and clean code.

# ProBarber - Architecture Showcase ⚙️

This repository serves as a **technical documentation and architectural overview** of the ProBarber SaaS platform. The project was built from the ground up (**Green Field**) to solve complex management challenges in the grooming industry.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Backend:** Laravel (PHP) with a focus on robust validation using FormRequests.
* **Frontend:** Angular utilizing **TanStack Query** for efficient state management and server-state synchronization.
* **Database:** MySQL for robust and lightweight data architecture.
* **Testing:** PHPUnit for automated backend testing to ensure reliability.

## 🏗 Key Engineering Pillars
My goal with this architecture was to implement the core concepts of high-performance systems:
* **Reliability:** High test coverage and error handling.
* **Scalability:** Database modeling designed to support high-load multi-tenant growth.
* **Maintainability:** Clean code principles and modular architecture for easy evolution.
* **White-Label Architecture:** Designed with a decoupled core, making the platform ready for rapid rebranding and niche adaptation (e.g., ProBeauty, ProPet) without code duplication.

## 🗺️ Roadmap & Future Enhancements
While the core SaaS engine is functional, the following features are planned to further improve scalability and developer experience:
* **Infrastructure:** Containerization using **Docker** for consistent environment orchestration.
* **Multi-Tenancy Architecture:** Implementing a robust data isolation layer to support multiple barber shops securely within the same infrastructure.
* **Advanced Analytics & Reporting:** Developing a comprehensive dashboard for business intelligence and financial insights.
* **Messaging Integration:** Automated customer notifications and appointment reminders via WhatsApp API.
* **Mobile Optimization:** Enhancing the current PWA (Progressive Web App) capabilities for a seamless mobile-first experience.

## 🎯 Product-Minded Approach
More than just code, this project was designed with **User Experience** in mind, ensuring that technical complexity never hinders operational efficiency.
